--- EAC

**EAC said they won't ban autoscripts**

EAC can eventually toggle this as a cheat.
But shouldn't as it actually only checks the game's files.

USE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK.
DEVS SAID THAT IF YOU ARE BANNED BY EAC THEY WON'T UNBAN YOU BUT **EAC SAID THEY WILL NOT BAN AUTO SCRIPTS** (as long they not give an advantage, something people are not able to do)
