# Infos

First, I want to say that there will be experimental uploads in dbd-autostruggle/experimental
If you want official releases, check the releases (https://github.com/rlevet/dbd-autostruggle/releases)

Maybe later I will add support for GitHub and remove website support or redirect to this GitHub. If I do it, I will say it.
Actually, there is more content on the website so go check it out :
https://rlevetspam.wixsite.com/dbd-autoscripts/struggle

Also, be sure to check autospace :
https://rlevetspam.wixsite.com/dbd-autoscripts/space
=> AutoSpace will be on GitHub soon
