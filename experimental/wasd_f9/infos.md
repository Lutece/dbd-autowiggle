This is a modified version of the WASD one.

Requested by someone who has a RU keyboard and it was not working for him.


### Changes

- You need to press "F9" instead of "F".
- "F9" is now a Toggle key, which means you only have to press again on it to disable.

### Anything else?

It will not work with dbd-autostruggle

### What does it do?

Only the toggle key changes, the script will spam "A" and "D" normally.
