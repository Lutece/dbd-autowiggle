Devs said they will not ban you for autowiggle and autostruggle but forum mods said that if you are banned, they will not unban you.
So devs said it was allowed.
But if you are banned they will not unban you (a mod said it).

I belive they will unban you and do a devstream about macros if people were banned for this.
So for me it's okay. But again, DO IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.

**If any dev say me that I need to delete this, I will.**
So yeah, stay tunned because I don't want to be banned and you too (I think).
