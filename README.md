### dbd-autostruggle
It's an AutoStruggle script for Dead by Daylight.
This is allowed and legit, legal. You will **NOT** be banned for that.

### How to install

Just go to the releases (https://github.com/rlevet/dbd-autostruggle/releases) and download the last .exe (or the one that is working).
Just run it and follow instructions.

### Is it safe?

**Yes.** I tested it the 25/09/2018 (Day/Month/Year format) and it was working and safe.
EasyAntiCheat didn't blocked it and it worked.

Working versions : **1.0.2** - 1.0.1 WEB

### How does it work?

The script spam A and D for the WASD version or Q and D for the ZQSD version.
The script is under a timer to make that it will not exceed human's speed. We also use a human like script (we do what a human will do).

**Just press "F" and it will do it. Release the button to stop.**

### It doesn't work, help me!

Post in Issues (https://github.com/rlevet/dbd-autostruggle/issues) and I will change a little the script for you.
Also, be sure to check old releases to see if any is working for you.
