**EAC said they won't ban autoscripts**

USE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK.

BUT DEVS SAID THAT IF YOU ARE BANNED BY EAC THEY WON'T UNBAN YOU BUT EAC SAID THEY WILL NOT BAN AUTO SCRIPTS (as long they not give an advantage, something people are not able to do)

So: you won't be banned for autoscripts (IN THEORY)
